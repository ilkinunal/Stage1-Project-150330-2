      When a user opens a web browser and writes www.udacity.com, the computer sends an HTTP request to a server. The server finds the HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer , the web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

    <div class="subtitle"> HTML </div>
      <div>
      HTML has &#34;Text content&#34; (what you see), &#34;markup&#34; (what it looks), &#34;references to other documents&#34; (images, videos, etc), &#34;links to other pages&#34;.
      <br>HTML consists of a series of codes typed into a text-file by the programmer; 

      <ul>
        <li>  
        <b>TAGs</b> - use <b> &#60; angle-brackets &#62;</b>,most tags have opening and closing tag, but some called &#34;void&#34; tag which does not require a closing tag. 
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>Element</b> - includes <b>opening tag</b> &#38; <b>content</b> &#38; <b>closing tag</b>. Elements can be <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>; Block elements create an &#34;invisible box&#34; around the content inside of them, such as &#34;p&#34;, &#34;div&#34;, &#34;form&#34;. &#34;a&#34;, &#34;span&#34;, &#34;br&#34;, &#34;img&#34; and &#34;strong&#34; are all inline elements.
    	  </li>
        <li>
        <b>Attribute</b> - provide additional information about an element , are specified in the opening tag.
        </li>
      </ul>

      The Structure of HTML document :
          <pre>         &#60;html&#62;
              &#60;head&#62; 
                 &#60;title&#62; TITLE &#60;&#47;title&#62;
              &#60;&#47;head&#62;
              &#60;body&#62;  
                 &#60;name&#62; CONTENT &#60;&#47;name&#62;
              &#60;&#47;body&#62; 
          &#60;&#47;html&#62;

  <h2>***HTML &#38; CSS &#38; DOM -lesson 2 </h2>  
  
    <div>
      <span>
      The browser turns HTML &#34;tags&#34; into &#34;elements&#34; that form a &#34;tree&#34;. It knows how to do that because of the <b>DOM</b> &#34;<b>Document Object Model</b>&#34;, which is a standard convention for representing and interacting with elements in HTML. Each HTML tag creates an element in the DOM that the browser uses to display the page.
      </span>
      <span>   
      <br>  The document written in HTML defines the <u><b>structure</b></u> and <u><b>content</b></u> of the page.To define the <u><b>style</b></u>, you have to use another language; <b>CSS</b> &#34;<b>Cascading Style Sheets</b>&#34;. CSS is used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.
      </span>
      <span>
      <br> DOM -a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages). The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.    
      </span>

      <ul>
        <li>  <b>ScratchPad</b> : beginner friendly, least powerful, sharing is not possible, HTML &#38; CSS </li>
        <li>  <b>Codepen</b> : powerful, easy for sharing but account needed, HTML &#38; CSS &#38; JavaScript </li>  
        <li>  <b>Sublime</b> : most powerful,but not quite friendly, difficult to share, all languages</li>

    <div class="subtitle"> Avoiding Repetition </div>
      <div>
      Coding principle is <em> don&#39;t repeat yourself (<b>DRY</b>)</em>. Avoiding Repetition makes it easier to create &#38; maintain &#38; expand, less likely for errors and mistakes. Also, it makes it faster loading of web pages, enables the clients to save money on bandwidth and development costs.
